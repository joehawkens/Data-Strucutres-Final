#### Data structures are a way to structure data. Some Data Structures work better than others depending on the problem you're solving.


# Queues [What is it?]

### Queues can be thought of as a line of customers at a grocery store. Where the customers represent the data being structured. When something is added, it starts in the back.
### Each customer is served when they reach the checkout counter (the front) and is then removed from the Queue.

## Documentation [How to use it]

### In the Python programming language, a Queue is implemented as a list, so if you wanted to make a Queue you'd simply make a list...
```
queue = []
```
### Common operations assosciated with the Queue...
```
Adding (Enqueue):      queue.append(item)
Removing (Dequeue):    queue.remove[0] OR queue.pop(0)    
Find size (Size):      size = len(queue)
``` 


## Implementation [When to use it]:

### How to use it: This data strucutre is effective when you need to make a "line" in a Software application. For instance, if you wanted to
