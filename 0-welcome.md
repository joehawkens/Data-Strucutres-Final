# Algorithms and Data Structures Essentials


## What are they?

### Both data structures and algorithms are ways to bring order out of chaos.
### Data Structures are, as the name implies, ways to structure data. Each data structure organizes data differently and because of this, some data structures are better suited than others for solving certain problems. In addition to this, Algorithms are used with data structures to iterate through the now organized data.
