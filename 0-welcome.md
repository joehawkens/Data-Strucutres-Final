# Algorithms and Data Structures


## What are they?

### Both data structures and algorithms are ways to bring order out of chaos.
### Data Structures are, as the name implies, ways to structure data. Each data structure organizes data differently and because of this, some data structures are better suited than others for solving certain problems. In addition to this, Algorithms are used with data structures to sort through the data to manipulate it in some way (add, remove, replace, edit).

### Data Structures and Algorithms are dependent on each other. You can't sort through data with algorithms if it isn't structured in some way and there's no point in structuring data if you don't plan to do anything with it.
  
# When to use it? (Big-O Notation)

Data Strucutres and Algorithms are the tools of the trade in Software Engineering, much like how a construction worker uses tools at a construction site. Some tools are better suited for certain problems based on the context of the problem(i.e. you wouldn't use a hammer to paint a wall). Therefore, it's important to understand your problem before randomly picking a tool to fix it.
