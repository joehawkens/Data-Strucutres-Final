# Trees [What is it?]

### The Tree data structure comes in many different flavors (Binary, Search, Red-Black, AVL, etc.) But to keep things grounded we will focus on only two types of the tree: Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST). The Tree at it's core is very similar to the Linked List in that it shares a structure of Nodes. However, unlike a linked list, a Node in a Tree is able to reference two other Nodes instead of one. And instead of iterating from left to right, a trees structure moves from top to bottom

# Documentation [How to use it?]

### In the Python programming language, a linked list is 
```

```
### Common operations assosciated with the Queue...
```
Adding (Enqueue):  
Removing (Dequeue):    
Find size (Size):      
``` 


# Implementation [When to use it?]:

### .....Big O

Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
-------|--------|-----------|----------|
 O(n)  |  O(n)  |   O(1)    |    O(1)  |

# Example:
### Let's see what this looks like with an example problem.

### Scenario: 
```
```
### Additional Example Notes

# Practice:

### Try this practice by implementing a linked list yourself...

### Scenario: .....
