# Trees [What is it?]

### The Tree data structure gets it's name from a tree in real life. You can imagine a tree flipped upside down. The Tree DS comes in many different flavors (Binary, Search, Red-Black, AVL, etc.) But to keep things grounded we will focus on only two types of the tree: Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST). The Tree at it's core is very similar to the Linked List in that it shares a structure of Nodes. However, unlike a linked list, a Node in a Tree is able to reference two other Nodes instead of one. Look at the diagram below for a visual representation:

### The Root Node represents the Node at the top, it's also a "parent" Node of the Nodes below it. These Nodes are known as it's children Node. And those Children Nodes are parents to the Nodes below them, this pattern repeats the bigger the Tree gets. The Nodes located at the bottom of the tree are known as it's leaves. It's also important to notice that there can be "Subtrees" inside of trees, which simply represent the recurring pattern mentioned earlier.

# Documentation [How to use it?]

### In the Python programming language, a linked list is 
```

```
### Common operations assosciated with the Queue...
```
Adding (Enqueue):  
Removing (Dequeue):    
Find size (Size):      
``` 


# Implementation [When to use it?]:

### .....Big O

Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
-------|--------|-----------|----------|
 O(n)  |  O(n)  |   O(1)    |    O(1)  |

# Example:
### Let's see what this looks like with an example problem.

### Scenario: 
```
```
